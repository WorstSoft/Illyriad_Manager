# Illyriad Manager
**It's an android application for showing your notification straight from your phone, currently supports only smartphone with android version 5.0, let me know if you want to make the app compatible with android verison 4.4 or less**
## Current Features
* Showing notification from the API into a readable version
## Incoming Features
* Adding different tab for combat reports and mail
* Ability for seeing the world map (Unlikely)
* Notification that will refresh automatically (Very unlikely but if it happens the other unlikely things listed here might be added)

You can add suggestion [here](https://github.com/WorstSoft/Illyriad_Manager/issues)

Thanks for using my app and keep playing Illyriad ^_^
